Project description and instructions:
My final project SQL embedded program is designed by using psycopg2 module from python3 combined with PostgreSQL database.
Since this is a python file, you don't need a makefile to execute it.

Warning:
My python file will not run locally on your machine since psycopg2 does not allow me to ssh to sfu server.


How to run my file:
Once you have logged in to CSIL by ssh and transfer my file there,
run my final.py file by entering command: python3 final.py


How to navigate inside my database:
When you have successfully run my file, you will be prompted to enter your own user name and password to csil-cpu1.csil.sfu.ca server.
For the host name, you can either enter your own host name, or press enter to choose the default: cs-db1.csil.sfu.ca
For the database name, you can either enter your own database name, or press enter to choose mine: cmpt354-jundic  (assuming you have the access to it)
Once you have entered all the credentials and if they are all correct, you will be able to navigate through my database.

Initially, I don't have any tables created on csil-cpu1.csil.sfu.ca sever under: cmpt354-jundic
You need to enter "0" to create all the tables and insert all the data first in order to choose other options to query from the database.
You can also enter "11" to see all the existing tables or "10" to drop all the existing tables and types.
If you enter other query options without creating the tables first, you will not be able to query anything.
Finally, if you are bored with my database, you can enter "8" to exit the program. If you are not bored, perhaps give me a good grade? LOL


Adjustments on the existing schema and reasons:
There are two adjustments that I had to make to the provided schema. The first one is, I added a 'request amount' column for the call table
since the provided table only has 'amount' that is intended for the awarded amount. However, in some query, such as query 5, we are asked to compare the
requested amount and the awarded amount. Adding this extra column will make this query possible.
The second one is that I had to add a table called "meeting" to accommodate the need for query 7 since it requires a room number which
I will have this piece of info in "meeting" table for further querying to accomplish this task.
